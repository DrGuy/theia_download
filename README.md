# theia_download

This is a simple piece of code to automatically download the products provided by Theia land data center : https://theia.cnes.fr. It can download the products delivered by Theia, such as the [Landsat L2A products](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?page_id=3487) and the [SpotWorldHeritage L1C products](https://www.theia-land.fr/en/projects/spot-world-heritage).

This code was written thanks to the precious help of one my colleague at CNES [Jérôme Gasperi](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rocket-earth-your-pocket-gasperi-jerome) who developped the "rocket" interface which is used by Theia, and the mechanism to get a token.

This code relies on python 2.7 and on the curl utility. Because of that, I guess it only works with linux.

## Examples
This software is still quite basic, but if you have an account at theia, and if you have accepted the necessary license, you may download products using command lines like 

- `python ./theia_download.py -l 'Toulouse' -a auth_theia.txt -d 2015-11-01 -f 2015-12-01`

 which downloads the LANDSAT 8 products above Toulouse, acquired in November 2015.

- `python ./theia_download.py --lon 1 --lat 43.5 -a auth_theia.txt -d 2015-11-01 -f 2015-12-01`

 which downloads the LANDSAT 8 products above --lon 1 --lat 43.5 (~Toulouse), acquired in November 2015.

- `python ./theia_download.py --lonmin 1 --lonmax 2 --latmin 43 --latmax 44 -a auth_theia.txt -d 2015-11-01 -f 2015-12-01`

 which downloads the LANDSAT 8 products in latitude, longitude box around Toulouse, acquired in November 2015.


- `python theia_download.py -l 'Toulouse' -a auth_theia.txt -c SpotWorldHeritage -p SPOT4 -d 2005-11-01 -f 2006-12-01`
 which downloads the SpotWorldHeritage products acquired by SPOT5 in 2005-2006

##Authentification 

The file auth_theia.txt must contain your email address and your password on the same line, such as follows :
`your.email@address.fr top_secret`

Please remember that you have to accept the licence corresponding to the product. This can only be done on line (https://theia.cnes.fr) by downloading manually one product.

The program first fetches a token using your email address and password, and then uses it to download the products. As the token is only valid for two hours, itis advised to request only a reasonable number of products.
